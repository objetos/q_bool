# Algebra

The quadrille algebra consists of [static methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_method) that apply logical operations to `quadrille` instances. Drawing inspiration from the principles of [constructive solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) and [boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), functions such as [neg]({{< relref "neg" >}}), [or]({{< relref "or" >}}), [xor]({{< relref "xor" >}}), [and]({{< relref "and" >}}), and [diff]({{< relref "diff" >}}) enable the creation of complex quadrilles from simpler ones, employing logical operations.
